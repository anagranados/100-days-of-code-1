**Day 27: January 1,1 2019**

**Today's Progress:** Add some styles to my Technical Documentation Page, the nav when the screen becomes smaller didnt have an scroll, also the page is very large so I added a button to top.

**Thoughts:** Added some javaScript code but I didnt understand it, I just copy and paste from the www3school website, later I will understand it better. The interesting thing is that I can copy  and I understand the right place to paste in my code to let it work.
