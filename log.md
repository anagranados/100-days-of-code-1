**Thoughts:** I had a struggle with the images, beacuse I wanted all of them with the same size, I controlled with his parent size. I learned how to center an element of many elements inside their father with flexbox, grid, margin, table, absolute positioning. I had problem with my header, it has to be fixed on the top, I added a pics with the tags figure and figcaption, so the figcaption has to be fixed for the animation that I wanted to do, but it was not possible for me to understand why it is not possible to make two elements with the position absolute in the same layout.
