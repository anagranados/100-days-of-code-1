The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [30/04/2019].

## Log

### R2D1 
Started to follow a workshop tutorial of MVC pattern working with ASP.Net and Visual Studio. I learned to create a project from scartch with MVC pattern, I added a new class, I learned some concepts of MVC. I found an error whenbuilding my project, it is an error that lock a folder and Visual Studio can't build mine. I've been trying to find the solution for more than one hour, I think is the antivirus that blocked the files.

### R2D2
Today I learned about the keywords OUT and REF. Also learned how to create a class, a contructors, the sets and gets, constructors with and without parameters.
I didn't do anything about the antivirus today because is not a working day, maybe tomorrow I will call to the administrator of the Bitdefender Security Tool at Sinergest
