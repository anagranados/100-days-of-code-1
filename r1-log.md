### R2D1 
Started to follow a workshop tutorial of MVC pattern working with ASP.Net and Visual Studio. I learned to create a project from scartch with MVC pattern, I added a new class, I learned some concepts of MVC. I found an error whenbuilding my project, it is an error that lock a folder and Visual Studio can't build mine. I've been trying to find the solution for more than one hour, I think is the antivirus that blocked the files.
